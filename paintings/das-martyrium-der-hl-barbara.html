  <p class="longtext">According to "Der Heiligen Leben" (The Lives of the Saints),[1] Barbara was locked in a tower by her heathen father, Dioscorus, to protect her from avid suitors. While there, she was baptized as a Christian and had a third window installed to symbolize the Trinity. Upon learning of this, Dioscorus flew into a rage and drew his sword to kill her. Barbara fled to a mountain cave, but was betrayed and delivered to a judge, who ordered her to be tortured for refusing to recant her faith. Having survived whipping, burning, beating, and the hacking off of her breasts, she was sentenced to decapitation. Dioscorus led his daughter up a mountain, where he cut off her head, but on the way down he was killed by a bolt of lightning.

This painting shows a luxuriously dressed Barbara kneeling before her father, who raises his sword (falchion) to behead her. Artistic license has been taken with Dioscorus"s attire: his helmet is a fantastical creation all" antica, a style popular at the time, and his knee defenses (polyens), typically steel, are heavily gilt.[2] The elderly man in the dark green robe and hat with earflaps standing behind Barbara is probably the judge who ordered her beheading. To his left is a courtly-looking fellow wearing a fur-trimmed yellow damask robe. One of the two soldiers to his right wears armor meant to look either antique or foreign. The large round reinforce on his left shoulder and the short sleeve of the mail shirt protruding from
under his shoulder defense are usually associated with mid-fifteenth-century Italian armor. As Dirk Breiding noted, "His gauntlets with "open cuffs" on the inside, the helmet with reinforcing discs on the sides (and a fantastical visor), and the skirt (made of downward-overlapping metal scales), especially its fabric part with the lower dagged edge and attached bells, were all fashionable particularly in German-speaking areas during the early to mid-fifteenth century."[3]

[1] Der Heiligen Leben of 1488 (Nuremberg: Anton Koberger), or a later version of it, was likely the edition of the lives of the saints that informed Cranach"s depiction of Saint Barbara"s life, as the earlier ones do not include her story.
[2] My thanks to Dirk H. Breiding, Assistant Curator, Department of Arms and Armor, MMA, for his comments on the armor worn by the figures in this painting (email to Maryan Ainsworth, March 27, 2012, curatorial files, Department of European Paintings, MMA).
